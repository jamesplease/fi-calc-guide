# About

FI Calc is a calculator that helps you plan for retirement using backtesting to
evaluate different withdrawal strategies.

### Proper Usage

FI Calc does not provide financial advice. Do not plan your retirement solely
off of the results of FI Calc. A healthy retirement plan will be studied using
multiple calculations. FI Calc can be one, but not the only, calculator that you
use.

### History

I created FI Calc in 2018 to be a retirement simulator that would work great on
mobile phones. The first version didn't have many features, and it was stashed
away in my virtual drawer of unfinished side projects. In 2020 I had a sudden
burst of motivation to start work on it again, and the result of that is the
application that you see today.
