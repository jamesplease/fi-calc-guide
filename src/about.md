# About

FI Calc is a calculator that helps you plan for retirement.

The goal of FI Calc is to provide all of the features one might need when
creating their retirement plan using historical data and Monte Carlo
simulations.

### History

I created FI Calc in 2018 to be a retirement simulator that would work great on
mobile phones. The first version didn't have many features, and it was stashed
away in my virtual drawer of unfinished side projects. In 2020 I had a sudden
burst of motivation to start work on it again, and the result of that is the
application that you see today.
