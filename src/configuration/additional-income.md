# Additional Income

Retiring does not necessarily mean that you're no longer bringing in money.
Sometimes, you may have additional income during some years of your retirement.
Example sources of additional income include:

- rental property cashflow
- selling a home
- social security
- a pension
- a side job
- a profitable side project
- inheritance

## Adding Additional Income

To add Additional Income, begin by expanding the "Additional Income" section of
the Configuration section of FI Calc. You can add as many additional income
sources as you would like.

Click the "Add Additional Income" button to open a window that lets you
configure your income.

### Name

You may choose to label your income. Providing a name can help you to stay
organized when you have multiple income sources. Providing a name is optional.

### Annual Amount

Additional income is considered annually. If you receive your income on a more
frequent schedule, then you should add up the total amount that you expect to
receive in a year and enter it here.

### Adjusting for Inflation

Over time, the dollar tends to afford you fewer and fewer things. This tendency
is called **inflation**. You may know that some of your income sources will be
adjusted for inflation. For example, you may have a job that gives you a raise
each year to match inflation.

If your income should be adjusted for inflation then you should check this
checkbox.

    <img width="281px" src="/images/configuration-income-value.jpg" alt="Check this checkbox to adjust Additional Income for inflation.">

</figure>

Inflation begins accumulating immediately, even when you specify that the income does not
begin after a number of years.

For example, if you specify that additional income of $10,000 beginning in 20 years, the
amount that you will receive on the 20th year will have $10,000 worth of purchasing
power. This typically means that it will be nominally larger than $10,000.

A future update will allow you to choose whether inflation adjustments begins immediately
or once the income starts. In the meantime, if you need a particular nominal amount, you
can compute what value would grow into that amount using a fixed inflation rate (like 3%)
and input that value into the text field.

Using the example above, you might enter $5,500. This is because $5,500 will become $9,933
after 20 years of inflation adjustments assuming 3% annual inflation.

### Income Frequency

FI Calc supports complex income frequencies. For example, you may know that you
plan to take 3 years off, and then get a side job for a couple of years.

Use the "Income Frequency" section to specify when you want your Additional
Income to begin, and for how long.

You may also specify that an income lasts forever. This might be useful for some
income streams such as Social Security or a pension.

## Modifying an Existing Additional Income

You can make changes to an Additional Income that you have already created. To
do so, click the target Additional Income in the list, and the edit window will
appear. Make your changes, and then click Save.

## Disabling One or More Additional Income Sources

You can temporarily disable an additional income source, which will re-run the
same calculation without factoring that income in.

This can be useful to quickly see the impact of different income sources on your
portfolio. Maybe you're considering getting a part time job, but you're not
committed to it. Or maybe you wish to see how much impact your Social Security
estimate has on your success rate.

Disabling income is a quick way to "turn off" income while still allowing you to
add it back into your calculation should you decide to.

To disable an Additional Income, uncheck the checkbox next to the income in the
Configuration pane.

## Deleting Additional Income

To delete an Additional Income that you have created, click an existing
Additional Income to open the Edit window. Then, click on the "Delete" button.

## Effect on Withdrawals

Additional income reduces your total withdrawal for the year.

This is best shown with an example: consider a year where you planned to spend
$40,000 of a $1,000,000 portfolio. Without any additional income, you would up
with \$960,000 remaining in your portfolio (before gains, fees, and so on).

If you have an additional income of
$10,000 that year, then your portfolio will instead
end up as $970,000. This is
equivalent to spending $30,000 for the year instead
of $40,000.

### How to Increase Spending With Income

The behavior described above explains how additional income reduces your
withdrawal. If you instead wish to _increase_ your spending when you receive
additional income, then you can simply omit the income from this calculator
altogether.

This may seem counterintuitive, but this calculator measures your portfolio over
time, and not your spending. That's why withdrawals are called "withdrawals" and
not "spending."

If you receive \$10,000 and immediately spend it, then it never touches your
portfolio and therefore has no effect on the calculations performed by this
calculator.
