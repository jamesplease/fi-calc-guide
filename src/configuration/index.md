# Making a Retirement Plan

Each person's retirement plan is unique, and FI Calc is designed to be flexible
enough to support as many needs as possible. In this section, you will learn all
of the ways that you can configure FI Calc to model your retirement.

On laptops and other large screens, the configuration for FI Calc is done on the
left-hand "Configuration" sidebar. On phones, configuration is done on first
page of the calculator.
