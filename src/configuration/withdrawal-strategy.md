# Withdrawal Strategy

Each year of your retirement, you must decide how much you will withdraw from
your portfolio. Most people wish to withdraw the most that they can to maximize
their quality of life, but not so much that they run out of money before the end
of their retirement.

### Changing the Withdrawal Strategy

The default withdrawal strategy is called
[Constant Dollar](../../withdrawal-strategies/constant-dollar). This is the
strategy used in the studies that derived The 4% Rule.

To choose a different strategy, locate the dropdown menu in the "Withdrawal
Strategy" section of the Configuration. All of the withdrawal strategy options
are listed inside of it, organized by group.

### Choosing the Right Withdrawal Strategy

The right strategy for you depends on your goals and the things that you value
in your retirement.

This is a deep topic; accordingly, there's an entire section of this guide
dedicated to describing the different withdrawal strategy options.

### Determining the Amount to Withdraw

Your withdrawal amount should cover all of your expenses for the year. Note that
you should also include the cost of taxes to your withdrawal amount, as FI Calc
does not automatically estimate what your taxes will be for each year.
