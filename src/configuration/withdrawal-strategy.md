# Withdrawal Strategy

Each year of your retirement, you must decide how much you will withdraw from
your portfolio. Most people wish to withdraw the most that they can to maximize
their quality of life, but not so much that they run out of money before the end
of their retirement.

### Changing the Withdrawal Strategy

To choose a different strategy, locate the dropdown menu in the "Withdrawal
Strategy" section of the Configuration. All of the withdrawal strategy options
are listed inside of it, organized by group.
