# Introduction

When planning a retirement, you have an important decision to make: how much
money will you withdraw from your investments each year? Most people wish to
withdraw as much as they can to maximize their quality of life, but not so much
that they run out of money.

It's impossible to know with certainty how much you can safely withdraw each
year, because you can't know how the market will perform during your retirement,
nor how long you will live. But there are ways to make an informed decision.

## Finding a Safe Withdrawal Rate

In the early 90's, a financial advisor named William Bengen came up with a novel
idea to determine a safe withdrawal rate: simulating retirements using
historical data. He took a retirement plan and calculated how it would have
performed if an individual had started their retirement in 1926. He calculated
each year of this simulated retirement (up to 50 years in his study), and determined
if there was any money left in the portfolio by the end. Once this was done, he
ran the simulation again, but this time he started the simulated retirement one year
later in the year 1927. He continued to repeat this process, running simulation
after simulation to see how different kinds of retirements would have fared
throughout history.

After running all of the simulations, he determined that retirement plans
survived about 95% of the time with a 4% initial withdrawal rate. A few years
after Bengen's study, a group of professors reconfirmed his results in a paper
called The Trinity Study. This result is now known as The 4% Rule, and
it remains a foundational idea in retirement planning today.

Using historical data to evaluate retirement plans can be a powerful tool if
you believe that the market during your retirement will perform no worse than
the worst market in the available data set.

## Other Withdrawal Strategies

In the time since the 4% Rule was originally conceived, new withdrawal
strategies have been created, each having different goals. Some attempt to
spend every dollar that you have to maximize your quality of life. Others
aim to preserve the value of your portfolio throughout the retirement.

What other strategies exist, and which one is most appropriate for you? You can
use FI Calc to find these answers.

## Using FI Calc

This calculator allows you to run your retirement simulations using historical
data, just like Bengen. You can recreate his original results, or tweak the
inputs to discover new ones. Run retirements that are shorter or longer, or that
withdraw less or more, and see how these changes impact success rates.

In addition to the withdrawal strategy used in The 4% Rule, FI Calc includes
others that you can use, too, and those strategies are just as configurable. You
can export your results as a CSV file and continue your calculations in your
spreadsheet app of choice.

FI Calc cannot guarantee that any retirement plan will succeed. As mentioned
before, nothing can provide you with that guarantee. But FI Calc _can_ help you
make more informed decisions around retiring by allowing you to explore
situations in which a particular retirement plan does well or poorly in.

## What Now?

You're ready to jump in and start running simulations. Or you can continue
