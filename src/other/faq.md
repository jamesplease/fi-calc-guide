# FAQ

### Does FI Calc provide financial advice?

No. We encourage you to speak to a licensed financial professional before making
any financial decisions.

### Where can I donate?

FI Calc is provided for free.

The costs associated with running FI Calc, and the time spent maintaining and
updating the app as well as responding to emails are supported by donations. You
can donate [here](https://gum.co/kgIVJ).

### How do I factor in taxes?

FI Calc does not automatically account for taxes. For this reason you must
include the money to pay your taxes in your withdrawal amount.

To give a simple example, if you know that you need $40,000 per year to live off
of, and you estimate that your tax bill will be $5,000 per year, then you should
aim to withdraw $45,000 per year to cover both your expenses and taxes.

If you would like to model a scenario where your taxes change over the course of
your retirement, you can use
[Additional Income](/configuration/additional-income/) and
[Additional Withdrawals](/configuration/additional-withdrawals/) to decrease or
increase your tax bill over time.

### I do not live in the United States. Can I use FI Calc?

Perhaps. There are a couple of things to consider if you live outside of the US:

- The historical data for equities and bonds are
  [based on US assets](/how-it-works/historical-data-source/). Do you have
  access to these assets, or similar US-based assets?
- Inflation in this calculator based on the Consumer Price Index, which is
  determined by the price of consumer goods in the US. It may not reflect
  historical inflation in your country.
- The historical values of the assets in this calculator are in USD. To convert
  these values to another currency would require knowing the exchange rate.
  Would it be appropriate to use the historical exchange rate, or something
  else?

### Will you be adding new data?

Yes, if the data is not currently up to date it should be updated soon. Data for
each year will typically be added in the second half of the following year.

As an example, data for the year 2050 could be expected to be added some time
around or after June 2051.

### Are the dollars shown in the results page real or nominal?

The results page shows real dollars. You can download the data as a CSV to see
nominal dollars.

### How can I enter real estate into FI Calc?

You can use the [Additional Income](/configuration/additional-income/) feature
of FI Calc to support real estate.

If you have a rental property, you can specify the annual cashflow as recurring
income for as long as you intend to own the home.

If you intend to sell the property, then you can add your earnings from the sell
as additional income in the year that you sell.

If there are more features you need to help manage your real estate investments,
please [let me know](/contact/).

### FI Calc is showing a 100% success rate for my retirement plan. Does that mean that I'll never run out of money?

No, it's an unfortunate fact that there is always the possibility that you will
run out of money during retirement. A 100% success rate in FI Calc only means
that the portfolio didn't run out of money in any of the simulations that it ran
using past data, but we cannot know what the future holds.

The goal of retirement planning isn't to obtain absolute certainty that the plan
won't fail, as we cannot ever achieve that. Instead, it's about building the
confidence that your plan can weather all kinds of different economic
conditions. A 100% success rate in FI Calc could be perceived as a strong
indicator that your plan is sufficient, but here are just a few things to
consider:

- What is the smallest withdrawal made in the calculation? Is that a realistic
  minimum withdrawal for you? What if you needed to live off of that amount next
  year? Could you do it? If not, consider increasing the minimum withdrawal in
  the Configuration. Does that change your success rate?
- Are all of your expenses accounted for? Healthcare, for example?
- Is your retirement length set at the default 30 years, or is it longer? The 30
  year retirement was originally used for individuals who were retiring at
  around 60 (optimistically assuming a 90 year life span). Maybe it would make
  sense to add a few extra years to see how the success rate changes, if at all.
- Do other retirement calculators return similar results?
- Have you run more advanced calculations, factoring in details such as RMDs and
  taxes (which are not a part of the FI Calc calculation)?

These are just a couple of questions you might want to ask yourself when running
retirement calculations to make sure that you're being as accurate as possible.

And, please remember that FI Calc does not provide financial advice, and that
you should always consult with a licensed financial professional before making
financial decisions.

### Other calculators return different results for the same inputs. Why is that?

This is to be expected as different calculators use different data sources and
different calculations with that data. We recommend using multiple calculators
to get a range of results.

FI Calc's data is documented [here](/how-it-works/historical-data-source/) and
the algorithm is documented
[here](https://ficalc.app/how-it-works/one-simulation-year/).

### How do you pronounce "FI Calc"?

Eff eye calc.
