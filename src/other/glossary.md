#### 4% Rule

The 4% Rule is a rule of thumb that says you can safely withdraw 4% of your
portfolio each year of your retirement. After the first year, this value is
adjusted for inflation for each subsequent year of your retirement.

The 4% Rule was originally described by William Bengen, and it was later
popularized by the Trinity Study.

#### Backtesting

data. FI Calc is a backtesting calculator. For more, read

Variable Percentage Withdrawal (VPW) strategy was created by members of the

#### Inflation

Inflation is the tendency of a currency to purchase less as time goes on.
Inflation from year to year is generally modest (around 3%), but it can add up
to have a considerable effect over long periods of time, such as retirements.
For this reason, it is important to understand and factor in inflation when
planning for retirement.

#### The Trinity Study

The Trinity Study is a colloquial name given to a study that was published by
three professors at Trinity College which helped to popularize the 4% Rule.

Sustainable" and the authors are Philip L. Cooley, Carl M. Hubbard, and Daniel
T. Walz.

#### Vanguard
