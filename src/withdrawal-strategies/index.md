# Withdrawal Strategies

The amount that you choose to withdraw from your portfolio on a given year is
determined by your **withdrawal strategy**. A withdrawal strategy is an
algorithm that may factor in things like how much you spent last year and the
current value of your portfolio to determine your current withdrawal amount.

FI Calc includes some of the most popular withdrawal strategies for you to
explore, and it groups the strategies into three groups based on their
similarities.
